# /risk coverage (MASTER.md part 2, the 18 parts)

Page file: `components/pages/apps/Risk.jsx` (+ `Risk.css`) · gallery: `docs/gallery/risk/` · metric id: `contact_sales_submit`

Open copy questions for James: dial labels not in `content/ui-strings.json` ("the line", "action", "reasons · tap one to set it back to neutral", "stage: '<stage>'", "Illustration. No figure on this page is a customer result."); chapter visual captions ("alert → case", "same call · same record · same model", "N of 4 facts"); the closing band repeats the h1's words.
Shared changes requested: `docs/requests/templates.md` (covers every Business 2 page).
Forks this page deleted: the framed dial card and its corner name, the 76px score and the ±weights (no invented digits), the floating dial and chapter pauses, the "+"-only openers (now labelled with Hanzo's words), the 26px caps "Next", the black "summon a person" pill (now underlined ink), every spring, the colour comments, the inert `data-cursor` attributes.

## 1. Strategy and conversion
- [x] Header comment has Persona, Goal, CTA, metric id, Signature, Beyond
- [x] One solid fill per viewport; "Talk to us" → /contact-sales
- [x] One h1; clear in 5 seconds
- [x] No dead button
- [x] Copy questions listed

Done here: gate: 1 h1, max 1 solid per viewport; the close has its own band with the solid ask.

## 2. Information architecture and navigation
- [x] One `<main id="main">`; shared skip link
- [x] Every link through `A`
- [x] n/a breadcrumb
- [x] Link parity 0 removed

Done here: parity links 7/7.

## 3. First impression and page narrative
- [x] Sells in 5 s; the needle and action move within 2.2 s
- [x] h1 CSS cut-in painted by the server; nothing above it
- [x] JS off legible
- [x] Hero gauge → statement and two faces → three chapters → cards → dark room → rules → plans → what it is not → band
- [x] Ends on a band ("Talk to us"), then footer
- [x] n/a Morph

Done here: one big thing per screen: the gauge in the hero, the 44px endpoints under a 32px statement, the 64px-free plans.

## 4. Conversion system
- [x] Kit `A` + `.w2-cta`
- [x] Sticky ask "Talk to us" (`data-thumb`)
- [x] n/a copy button
- [x] `data-cta` on hero (`risk.hero`), band (`risk.close`) and the Next card (`risk.next`)

Done here: hero and band both carry `data-thumb="Talk to us"`.

## 5. Trust and proof
- [x] No logo, seal or invented number (the score digits and weights are gone)
- [x] Figures traced: twenty rules, five-year clock, four sanction lists (Hanzo's)
- [x] n/a marquees
- [x] n/a submit

Done here: the dial is labelled an illustration in Hanzo's words.

## 6. Content presentation (copy untouched)
- [x] Phone text 14px+ (mono capitals 12px)
- [x] Measures held; long opener labels wrap with the "+" unsquashed
- [x] Sheets via OpenSheet (focus trapped)
- [x] `parity.py /risk`: 0 missing

Done here: parity `text 114/114 links 7/7`.

## 7. Visual design system
- [x] `taste.py` passes (0 hues)
- [x] No label above a headline ("Next" is a 12px mono caption above its links, not a headline)
- [x] Tiles flat; the chapter visuals float
- [x] One icon set
- [x] Differs from neighbours: an unframed gauge, not a desk or window

Done here: gate hues [].

## 8. UI component library
- [x] Hover in `@media (hover:hover)`, press .98, focus-visible
- [x] Stage tabs take arrow keys, Home and End; facts are switches
- [x] Sheets trap Tab and return focus
- [x] No bare `:hover`
- [x] Forks deleted: listed above

Done here: fact switches get an ink border on hover.

## 9. Motion and interaction
- [x] Signature (the live dial), supporting: Settle, PinChapters, sheets; 0 fade-ups
- [x] Idle (dial, chapter visuals, event stream, rule card, declare stack, request flow; all stop out of view), pointer (reasons, switches), state (sheets), arrival (h1)
- [x] Moves without input; every control answers
- [x] Reduced motion rests; no springs
- [x] n/a sound (shared kit)

Done here: the action word holds a two-line box at both widths, so nothing under the dial moves when it flips.

## 10. Media
- [x] n/a images; Sigil drawing in Next
- [x] n/a video
- [x] n/a
- [x] n/a

Done here: one Sigil (seed hanzo-risk) beside Next.

## 11. Mobile and responsive
- [x] 375×812 and 1470×801 pass with no overlap
- [x] No horizontal scroll at 320
- [x] Targets 44px+
- [x] Primary above the fold at 375×667

Done here: the phone gauge stays full width (`align-items: stretch`); the dial pause sits beside the stage tabs.

## 12. Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- [x] Contrast measured
- [x] Pause beside the stage tabs, under the chapter visual, beside the event stream
- [x] n/a forms
- [x] One h1; h2/h3 order
- [x] Keyboard reaches every control

Done here: the dial's result is `aria-live` only after the visitor acts.

## 13. Performance and engineering
- [x] h1 in server HTML
- [x] No images
- [x] No poller, no third party
- [x] Nothing heavy on James's laptop

Done here: one client island.

## 14. SEO and machine files
- [x] Title and description from `content/pages.json`
- [x] Canonical from shared layout
- [x] `<JsonLd route="/risk" />`
- [x] Cards open sheets

Done here: `app/risk/page.jsx`.

## 15. Catalogue and product pages
- [x] n/a
- [x] Cards open into sheets
- [x] n/a
- [x] n/a (nothing priced)

Done here: n/a.

## 16. Developer experience
- [x] Endpoints shown as Hanzo writes them (/v1/aml, /v1/risk, POST /v1/event)
- [x] n/a config
- [x] n/a terminal
- [x] No version

Done here: n/a beyond the endpoints.

## 17. States and resilience
- [x] Dial: every reason neutral reads "allow"; switches: none or all facts
- [x] Blocked network: complete page, no console errors
- [x] n/a submit
- [x] n/a

Done here: look.cjs both widths errors none.

## 18. Measurement and handover
- [x] `data-cta` on every primary
- [x] Nothing identifier-bearing
- [x] `V2:` line in `app/risk/page.jsx`
- [x] Review requested from an independent critic after this pass

Done here: previous review 6/10; all eight fixes addressed. Round 2 (this pass): "Rules, lists and suppression" gets a rule card (list chips light, Lists → Suppression, a "suppressed" stamp), the declare stack steps while in view instead of playing once, "How it connects" gets a request-flow drawing (your system → Risk, a decision back, the processor untouched), stage tabs take Home/End, off-deck greys swapped to the deck ramp, radii moved to the MASTER set, dead CSS dropped. Phone: the header's "Try Hanzo" stays solid (shared Ask.jsx), so the page's own asks are the quiet ring there: one solid per viewport.
