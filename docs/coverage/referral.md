# /referral coverage (MASTER.md part 2, the 18 parts)

Page file: `components/pages/Referral.jsx` · gallery: `docs/gallery/referral/` · metric id: `signup_start`

Open copy questions for James: none decided. Only the 21 strings of `content/live/referral.json` appear; the invented channel names, row labels and the split affiliate sentence from the earlier build are gone.
Shared changes requested (`docs/requests/<page>.md`): `docs/requests/referral.md` (Ask.jsx: on phones, quiet header while the hero ask shows, then the header carries the page's ask; done page-locally until then).
Forks this page deleted: hand-rolled `xp-cta`/`xp-ghost` anchors (now kit `Cta`), the icon boxes and the grey list-plus-box stage (now one strip), every tiled marquee (now one pinned journey), the share-chip list and the channel-name rail, the definition-list dark room and its second "Affiliates" link, every Apple grey.

## 1. Strategy and conversion
- [x] Header comment has Persona, Goal, CTA, metric id, Signature, Beyond
- [x] One solid fill per viewport; label and href are the live page's ("Get your link" → /signup?next=/referral)
- [x] One h1; the page is clear in 5 seconds
- [x] No dead or self-looping button; n/a prices
- [x] Open copy questions listed, none decided

Done here: one `<h1>` in server HTML; at the top the header is an outline at both widths (measured `rgba(0,0,0,0)` background) beside the hero's solid "Get your link"; after the hero the header is solid "Get your link" (measured `rgb(10,10,10)`) at 1470 and 375.

## 2. Information architecture and navigation
- [x] One `<main id="main">`; skip link reaches it (`app/layout.jsx`)
- [x] Every link through `A` or `Cta`
- [x] n/a breadcrumb: depth 1
- [x] Link parity: 0 removed, 0 unexpected

Done here: `parity.py /referral` → links 3/3 (/signup, /login, /affiliate).

## 3. First impression and page narrative
- [x] Sells in 5 s; something moves within 1 s without input
- [x] Line-masked h1; nothing above the h1
- [x] JS off: legible; no `opacity:0` on the LCP element
- [x] One idea per section, each shown once: the card, one referral's journey (one word big at a time, the link pill once), the steps strip, the one difference (two tracks), the close
- [x] Ends on a closing band: the sign-in line, the ask ("Get your link", Sign in) and the card at rest, then the footer
- [x] n/a Morph: no card opens a page

Done here: the journey pins for 260svh on wide screens (stacks and plays once by itself under 900px); the dark room opens from a 32px inset (8px on phones, inside the text's 24px margin, so no letter is cut); the close shows the card with the rider on Qualified.

## 4. Conversion system
- [x] `<Cta>` only; no raw `.x-btn`
- [x] Sticky ask in the header after the hero, same label, at both widths; no bottom bar (measured 0 `.x-ask`); the header returns to quiet while the closing ask is on screen, at both widths
- [x] n/a copy: signed-out Copy is `aria-disabled`; pressing it shakes the link and lights Sign in, never says Copied
- [x] `data-cta` (`referral.hero`, `referral.close`) and `data-thumb` on the primary

Done here: `usePhoneHeaderAsk` mirrors the desktop Ask.jsx move on phones (request filed).

## 5. Trust and proof
- [x] No logo, no seal, no invented number (counts show an em dash, as signed out on hanzo.ai)
- [x] No figure to trace; the pay tracks carry no numbers
- [x] n/a marquee: none left; the only loops (flow dots, pay tracks, the rider's breath) are ambient and freeze under reduced motion
- [x] n/a Privacy: no form

Done here: the journey carries only Hanzo's words (Referred, Pending, Qualified, `hanzo.ai/?ref=…` once).

## 6. Content presentation (copy untouched)
- [x] No text under 13px (14px phone) except mono capitals
- [x] Headings balanced; the dark room's two sentences sit in two columns (5/7)
- [x] Steps are `aria-pressed` buttons that replay their drawing; no table, FAQ or code
- [x] `python3 scripts/parity.py /referral`: 0 missing

Done here: parity `text 20/20 links 3/3`; no word on the page outside `content/live/referral.json`.

## 7. Visual design system
- [x] `taste.py` passes; deck greys only
- [x] No label above a headline ("Referrals" sits under the asks)
- [x] Radii 16/20/24/full; flat tiles
- [x] One icon set; no icon in a rounded box
- [x] Differs from /affiliate (display link, sticky chapters with a box) and /bounty: the signed-out card, a pinned one-word journey and a four-column strip

Done here: `taste.py components/pages/Referral.jsx components/pages/Referral.css` → OK.

## 8. UI component library
- [x] Every control has hover (in `@media (hover:hover)`), press, focus-visible
- [x] Focus ring on every Tab stop
- [x] n/a dialogs
- [x] n/a inputs
- [x] Forks deleted: listed above

Done here: Copy fills ink; steps lift 2px and ink; the "Affiliates" link brightens and moves its underline; press .97 or 1px.

## 9. Motion and interaction
- [x] One signature (the journey) plus 3 (line-mask h1, the card's landing builder, the dark room opening); 0 fade-ups; `variety.py` OK (3 techniques)
- [x] Kinds: idle (flow dots, pay tracks, the rider's breath), time (builder lands once, strip draws once, phone journey plays once), pointer (hovers), state (step replays, word cut-ins), arrival (h1, room opening); scroll-linked is the journey and the room only
- [x] `motion.mjs`: 0 still screens at both widths, layout shift 0.002–0.003
- [x] Reduced motion: final states (card on Qualified, journey on Qualified, all four drawings, affiliate track full); no `setInterval`
- [x] Sound: `data-sound="tick"` on steps and Copy

Done here: slice D (7 Nov) re-verified the motion-map rebuild: the h1 slot-roll, the How-it-works word-shuffle (now each word rises into its own place in shuffled order, so no word ever crosses another), the dark room's cursor-lens, the counts dealt from one deck, and the close (the card holds at the top of a short pinned stage while the sign-in panel rises with the scroll and parks right under it, never over it, then both leave together). Earlier: `motion.mjs /referral` desktop 0 still (its Copy/Affiliates "dead hover" lines come from headless Chrome not matching `(hover: hover)`; Playwright with a fine pointer measures Copy going from white to `rgb(10,10,10)`), phone 0 still and 0 dead controls.

## 10. Media
- [x] n/a `Film`/`Pic`: no Hanzo photo or film on this page
- [x] n/a videos
- [x] No images to size
- [x] n/a photos

Done here: every object is DOM or inline SVG.

## 11. Mobile and responsive
- [x] 375×812 and 1470×801 pass with no overlap (flow dots run on their own track under the tiles)
- [x] No horizontal scroll (0 at 375)
- [x] Targets 44px or more
- [x] Primary ask above the fold at 375×667 (y ≈ 315)

Done here: slice D (7 Nov): `check.mjs /referral` passes at 1470×801 and 375×812 (0 errors, no overlay, scrollWidth 1470/375); no in-page target under 44px at 375 (the close's Sign in link now 44px); on phones How it works is the question card then the summary, whose four steps are listed from the start in grey and ink with a drawn check as each is done (no tall empty box); the close stage parks the panel under the card at 375 too.

## 12. Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- [x] Text at 4.5:1 or better (unlit rail words #737373)
- [x] n/a pause: no loop over 5 s carries content; the journey follows the scroll and the strip ends at rest
- [x] n/a forms
- [x] One h1; h2s for How it works, the dark room and the close
- [x] Keyboard reaches every step button and both asks

Done here: the summary's pending steps are readable (#737373, no longer aria-hidden) and turn ink when done; Copy is `aria-describedby` the sign-in line; the tracks are `aria-hidden` beside the sentences they draw.

## 13. Performance and engineering
- [x] h1 and lede in server HTML
- [x] No new dependency; no rAF loop
- [x] No poller; no third-party request
- [x] Filming in the cloud only

Done here: 200 and 0 console errors at both sizes.

## 14. SEO and machine files
- [x] Title and description from the live page
- [x] Canonical from shared metadata
- [x] `<JsonLd route="/referral" />` renders
- [x] n/a cards

Done here: `app/referral/page.jsx` metadata unchanged.

## 15. Catalogue and product pages
- [x] n/a: not a catalogue or model page
- [x] n/a Morph
- [x] n/a model links
- [x] n/a prices

Done here: n/a, a programs page.

## 16. Developer experience
- [x] n/a: no code
- [x] n/a config
- [x] n/a terminal
- [x] n/a versions

Done here: n/a, the only mono text is `hanzo.ai/?ref=…`.

## 17. States and resilience
- [x] Signed-out state designed (Hanzo's own)
- [x] No live data
- [x] n/a submit
- [x] The header hook restores the header on unmount

Done here: `usePhoneHeaderAsk` undoes its label, href and `data-ask` on route change.

## 18. Measurement and handover
- [x] `data-cta` on every primary; events through the kit's `hz-event`
- [x] Nothing before consent
- [x] `V2:` line in the page file
- [x] Review read: `docs/review/referral.md` (7/10, third walk) fix list answered: the step 03 needle now rotates by CSS with `transform-box: view-box; transform-origin: 200px 220px`, measured in Playwright at 0.00px from the hub at rest (50°), mid-replay (37.7°) and after replay, at 1470 and 375; every other anchor measured the same way (share dots, the locked account, the waitlist bar: 0.00px). The hero's dead band is gone: the journey's word peeks under the hero at 1470×801 and its stage sticks at 22svh, so nothing blank follows it

Done here: 1 the tiled rails became one pinned journey (link once, one word big at a time); 2 phone clip starts at 8px inside a 24px text margin; 3 the close is a band with the card at rest; 4 the steps are one four-column strip, not a list beside a grey box; 5 "Affiliates" shows once; 6 phone header goes quiet at the closing ask.
