/* Persona: enterprise buyer (fraud, AML and trust-and-safety leads). Goal: start a sales conversation. CTA: "Talk to us" → /contact-sales. Metric: contact_sales_submit.
   Risk. V2: 8/10 a first screen of h1 + dial side by side (next section peeking); the decision word decodes (the motion-map signature); chapters as rows with their own stepping object; slice D: the ink-spread on "What it decides on" now fires (it watched its own clipped box and never arrived, leaving an empty screen); deck greys and radii
   Signature: the dial that decides, and shows its work. Pick a stage (signup, payment, post-purchase; the stage is a
   field) and signals light; the needle swings to a score and the plane returns an action and its reasons. It never
   declines on its own: past the line it summons a person, the ceiling Hanzo's engine refuses to start above.
   Beyond: "Attribution, by hand". Set any signal back to neutral and score again; the drop is that signal's
   contribution, exactly how Hanzo says its scores explain themselves. The dial is labelled an illustration, because no
   figure on this page is a customer result.
   Motion budget: signature = the live dial; supporting = Settle, Chapters (PinChapters), Open (sheets). No springs.
   Colour: none (JAMES.md, 0 UI hues); the hot side of the dial is ink, status reads by shape and word. Every self-running
   demo has a pause control. One dark room: "Your data, your model". Every word and link is Hanzo's. */
