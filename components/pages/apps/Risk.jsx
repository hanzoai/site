/* Persona: enterprise buyer (fraud, AML and trust-and-safety leads). Goal: start a sales conversation. CTA: "Talk to us" → /contact-sales. Metric: contact_sales_submit.
   Risk, v2. V2: 8/10 Stage hero (the dial arrives huge and settles), three pinned chapters (compliance, lifecycle, agents), cards that open into sheets, one dark room, red accent
   Signature: the dial that decides, and shows its work. Pick a stage (signup, payment, post-purchase; the stage is a
   field) and signals light; the needle swings to a score and the plane returns an action and its reasons. It never
   declines on its own: past the line it summons a person, the ceiling Hanzo's engine refuses to start above.
   Beyond: "Attribution, by hand". Set any signal back to neutral and score again; the drop is that signal's
   contribution, exactly how Hanzo says its scores explain themselves. The dial is labelled an illustration, because no
   figure on this page is a customer result.
   Motion budget: signature = the live dial; supporting = Stage (Settle), Chapters (PinChapters), Open (sheets).
   Colour: none (JAMES.md, 0 UI hues); the hot side of the dial is ink, status reads by shape and word. Every self-running
   demo has a pause control. One dark room: "Your data, your model". Every word and link is Hanzo's. */

        <Detail title="Your data, your model" kicker="In development" wide>
          <p>Most fraud products score you against a pooled model built from other people’s traffic. Hanzo already holds yours. Analytics, product events and errors arrive through one endpoint — <strong>POST /v1/event</strong> — and are stored as rows scoped to your organization, beside your model usage, in a warehouse Hanzo runs and every tenant shares. That endpoint is live today. Reading those events as features and training on them is what is coming: your users, your products, your normal.</p>
          <p>The boundary is the hard part, and the commitment is that it will be enforced in the code rather than asserted in a policy. A feature read will not be expressible without a tenant. The organization will come from your verified identity, never from a field a caller can set. Anything shared across organizations will be an <strong>aggregate</strong> — published quantiles, with no organization, no subject and no identifier in the row — and a bucket too few organizations contributed to will not be published at all. The model is meant to be per organization down to its geometry, so that two organizations do not merely keep separate counters; they have separate models.</p>
          <p>Two of the properties that plane needs are already in the engine’s behavioural model, and it is those that will be carried forward. A score there is attributable by construction: move one input back to its neutral value, score again, and the drop is that input’s contribution — no second model is asked to explain the first. And a statistical judgement may summon a person; it may not decline anything on its own, a ceiling the engine refuses to start above. On the live deployment that model runs in <strong>shadow</strong>: it scores, and it contributes nothing to any transaction’s outcome.</p>

          <p>Hanzo does not process payments — your processor does, and <A to="/commerce">Hanzo Commerce</A> owns the money plane. There is no dispute-network integration today: Risk assembles the evidence, you submit it. No figure on this page is a customer result, because the decide plane has not carried customer traffic yet. When it has, the numbers here will be ours and measured.</p>
          <p>Three unmet requirements decide whether this is enough on its own, and they are named here rather than left to be found. There is no report workflow — no drafting, no approval step, no filing. There is no filing clock, so no deadline is measured anywhere. And there is no confidentiality marking on a case, so nothing in the engine keeps a case note away from the customer. What is here is the detection and the record; the filing is not.</p>
          <p>Anti-money-laundering compliance and fraud prevention are related jobs, not one job. <strong>/v1/aml</strong> is the compliance face, <strong>/v1/risk</strong> is the decide plane, and one engine serves both. Nearby: <A to="/idv">identity verification</A> for proving who somebody is, <A to="/guard">Guard</A> for what a model is allowed to say, and <A to="/analytics">Analytics</A> for the event plane the model reads.</p>
